#### What are these files?

These are Addons used on the Minecraft Bedrock server - **KoronaŚwiat**
If you want to know more about this server, please visit the [server page](https://wiktorwox.wixsite.com/koronaswiat). Most of the files are in **.json** format, but there are others, such as:
- **.mcfunction** - it is a file format with a list of commands used in Minecraft Bedrock that can be run in Minecraft using the command `/function [name of .mcfunction file]`
- **.png** - basic graphic file format. In McAddons, it is most often used for textures, item icons and pack icons

In [Behavior Pack](../packs/KoronaSwiat_Behavior_Pack) are defined behaviors of items, entities, bioms e.t.c. But in [Resource Pack](../packs/KoronaSwiat_Resource_Pack) there are files that deal with the appearance of certain things
